= Devops with Java EE, Jenkins, WildFly

. Step 1
.. Run Java EE 7 application in WildFly as a Docker container
.. Configure Jenkins as a Docker container, automatically create the job
.. Jenkins is configured to poll github repo every 10 mins, and if there is any change, run Arquillian unit tests and report the results (where would slave be running ? Or will the job run on master ?)
. Step 2
.. Add static code analysis using Cobertura plugin (run on a separate container ?)
. Step 3
.. Add integration/functional testing using Arquillian
... Selenium with different browsers
. Step 4
.. Add UAT with manual input
. Step 5
.. A/B testing

= Ideas

. Add security testing in the pipeline
. How can Jenkins on Docker contianer can be hooked using github webhook
. Run the entire setup on OpenShift Online
. Run the entire setup on OpenShift Enterprise
. Show how Jenkins can track the WAR file was deployed
. Update Java EE 7 application which require cross-container communication

= Getting started (WIP)

. Checkout this git repository
`git clone https://github.com/arun-gupta/devops.git`
. Build docker image to run this demo
`docker build -t devops-demo .`
. Run docker container
`docker run -p 8080:8080 -it devops-demo`
. Point your browser to jenkins
.. When using http://192.168.53.103:8080[boot2docker]
